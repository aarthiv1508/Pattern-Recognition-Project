# Prediction of Uber fares using Regression algorithms

The model aids in foreseeing Uber fares using different regression models. In the proposed methodology, exploratory data analysis is performed to detect the apparent flaws, visualize the patterns between the variables, identify the outliers and establish relations between the different variables. Next, data is preprocessed to make it more organized and transform the information into a suitable format for further analysis. The dataset is then split into training and test datasets through data manipulation techniques. Later, feature selection is implemented to identify the main features that contribute the most to predicting the target variable. Finally, predictive modeling is done through different regression models - Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Polynomial Regression, XGboost Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor Models, to observe the behavior, analyze the error and accuracy metrics and choose the best model.
